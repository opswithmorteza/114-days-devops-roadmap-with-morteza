# 🚀 114-Day DevOps Roadmap

This repository documents a **114-day, project-based journey** from Linux foundations to production-grade DevOps.

> Public by design: every day includes notes, a hands-on lab, and references.  
> Use it as a **learning path** or a **quick reference**.

## 📅 Phases
- **Day 01–14:** Linux (LPIC-1 & LPIC-2 essentials)
- **Day 15–28:** Advanced Linux (LPIC-3 topics)
- **Day 29–114:** DevOps path (Git, Bash/Python, Docker, CI/CD, Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes, Cloud, Observability, Security, Capstone)

## 🗂️ Structure
Each day lives in its own folder:
```
Day-001_Linux_Basics/
  ├─ notes.md      # commands, concepts, gotchas, references
  └─ project/      # code/config/scripts for the lab
```
Shared content:
```
Cheatsheets/      # quick reference
roadmap/          # PDF roadmap
assets/           # visuals (cover image)
scripts/          # helper scripts
.github/workflows # CI for linting & link checks
```

## 🧭 Start Here
1. Browse **PROGRESS.md** for the full day-to-day index.
2. Open the day’s `notes.md` and follow the lab in `project/`.
3. Share learnings publicly (optional).
