## Project 1: User & Group-Based Shared Directory with Controlled Access

### Problem

A small company has three teams: developers, testers, and admins. Requirements:

* Each team should have its own group
* Users should have read/write access only to their teamâ€™s directory
* Admins should have full access to all directories
* Users should **not** be able to delete files owned by other teams' users

### Solution

```bash
# 1. Create groups
sudo groupadd developers
sudo groupadd testers
sudo groupadd admins

# 2. Create users and assign groups
sudo useradd -m alice -G developers
sudo useradd -m bob -G testers
sudo useradd -m carol -G admins

# 3. Create project directories
sudo mkdir /project_dev /project_test /project_admin

# 4. Set group ownership and permissions with SGID and sticky bit
sudo chown :developers /project_dev
sudo chmod 2770 /project_dev

sudo chown :testers /project_test
sudo chmod 2770 /project_test

sudo chown :admins /project_admin
sudo chmod 2770 /project_admin

sudo chmod +t /project_dev /project_test /project_admin

# 5. Set ACLs for admins to have full access
sudo setfacl -m g:admins:rwx /project_dev /project_test /project_admin
sudo setfacl -d -m g:admins:rwx /project_dev /project_test /project_admin
```

### Explanation

* **SGID** ensures new files inherit the directoryâ€™s group
* **Sticky bit** prevents users from deleting files they donâ€™t own
* **ACLs** give admins full control over all project directories

## Project 2: Permission Audit and Fix Script for Security Hardening

### Problem

For improved security on a Linux server, create a script that:

* Lists all files with **SUID** or **SGID** bits set
* Finds shared directories without the **sticky bit**
* Fixes permissions of executable files lacking special bits to `755`
* Generates a detailed report of findings and changes

### Solution

```bash
#!/bin/bash

REPORT="/tmp/permission_audit_report.txt"
echo "Permission Audit Report - $(date)" > $REPORT

# 1. List files with SUID or SGID
echo -e "\nFiles with SUID or SGID bits:" >> $REPORT
find / -perm /6000 -type f 2>/dev/null >> $REPORT

# 2. Find shared directories missing sticky bit
echo -e "\nShared directories without sticky bit:" >> $REPORT
find /tmp /var/tmp /shared -type d ! -perm -1000 2>/dev/null >> $REPORT

# 3. Fix executable file permissions without SUID/SGID
echo -e "\nFixing executable files permissions:" >> $REPORT
for file in $(find /usr/local/bin /usr/bin -type f -executable ! -perm /6000 2>/dev/null); do
    chmod 755 "$file"
    echo "Set 755 on $file" >> $REPORT
done

echo -e "\nAudit and fixes completed." >> $REPORT
cat $REPORT
```

### Explanation

* Finds sensitive files (SUID/SGID) for review
* Ensures shared directories use sticky bit for safety
* Normalizes executable file permissions to 755 unless special bits set
* Logs all operations for auditing purposes
