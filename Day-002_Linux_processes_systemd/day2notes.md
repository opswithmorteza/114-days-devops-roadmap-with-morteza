ðŸ“‚ Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)

The FHS defines the directory structure and directory contents in Linux systems.

Key directories include:

/bin â€” essential user binaries

/boot â€” static files for boot loader

/dev â€” device files

/etc â€” system configuration files

/home â€” user home directories

/mnt or /media â€” mount points for removable media

/var â€” variable files like logs

Tip: Always mount additional storage under /mnt or create dedicated directories like /data to keep the hierarchy clean.

ðŸ”§ Partitions and Filesystem Types

Disk partitioning divides a physical disk into multiple partitions â€” logical segments with independent filesystems.

Common filesystems:

ext4: default, reliable, journaling

xfs: high performance for large files

btrfs: advanced with snapshots, compression

swap: for virtual memory

ntfs, vfat: for Windows compatibility

ðŸ”‘ UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)

A UUID uniquely identifies a partition or filesystem, e.g.,
